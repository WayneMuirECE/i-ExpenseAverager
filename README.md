# i-ExpenseAverager
This project is a simple budgeting tool. It is developed in C# and .Net with the primary user interface being in WinForms.

This is a project I worked on several years ago and used it to build my own household budget. The app was originally included within another project and I decided it would be far more effective on it's own. To that end this GitHub project is designed to do just that, make the app stand on it's own and to add features that will prove useful.

The concept is to input your expenses into categories that you define and then be able to see how much you spend in all categories or a single category per week on average. You can also see what you spend each day.

Q: Why calculate the average on the week instead of the month?

A: There are always 52 weeks in a year. The number of days per week never changes. The number of days per month always changes. Quite a few jobs pay on the bi-weekly or weekly basis. Knowing your average is the road to knowing your direction.

The app also includes the weekly average for the last month, last three months, last six months, last year, and average over all the time periods ((month, three month, six month) / year). This is so you can see if there is a change in recent expenditures.

This project is a work in progress and not all features are complete. Expect more development to come.
